# Changelog

This plugin is bundled along with the GoCD server, hence there will be no separate release of the plugin. Any notable changes would be listed here against the git commit.

## [3601af8](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/commit/3601af806a2781ca679cc0f5dae485a37319818a) - Bundled with *GoCD v17.5.0*


### Changed

1. Authorization Configuration changes
  * `ManagerDN` is non-mandatory, `Password` is required only if a `ManagerDN` is specified.
  * `DisplayNameAttribute` is optional and defaulted to `cn`.
  * `EmailAttribute` is optional and defaulted to 'mail'.
  * `LoginAttribute` changed to `UserLoginFilter` which is an LDAP search filter used during authentication to lookup for a user entry matching the given expression.
  * `SearchAttribute` changed to `UserSearchFilter` which is an LDAP search filter used to lookup for users matching a given search term.
2. Verify Connection validates the auth config before checking connection.

### Fixed

1. When multiple search bases are defined, a invalid search base should not error out the operations. Errors are logged and the operation continues with the next search base.


### [v0.0.1(Experimental)](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/releases/tag/0.0.1)


    Initial release of plugin.
